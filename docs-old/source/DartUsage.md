Use in Dart    {#flatbuffers_guide_use_dart}
===========

## Before you get started

Before diving into the FlatBuffers usage in Dart, it should be noted that
the [Tutorial](@ref flatbuffers_guide_tutorial) page has a complete guide
to general FlatBuffers usage in all of the supported languages (including Dart).
This page is designed to cover the nuances of FlatBuffers usage, specific to
Dart.

You should also have read the [Building](@ref flatbuffers_guide_building)
documentation to build `flatc` and should be familiar with
[Using the schema compiler](@ref flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler) and
[Writing a schema](@ref flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema).

## FlatBuffers Dart library code location

The code for the FlatBuffers Dart library can be found at
`flatbuffers/dart`. You can browse the library code on the [FlatBuffers
GitHub page](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/tree/master/dart).

## Testing the FlatBuffers Dart library

The code to test the Dart library can be found at `flatbuffers/tests`.
The test code itself is located in [dart_test.dart](https://github.com/google/
flatbuffers/blob/master/tests/dart_test.dart).

To run the tests, use the [DartTest.sh](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/
blob/master/tests/DartTest.sh) shell script.

*Note: The shell script requires the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk)
to be installed.*

## Using the FlatBuffers Dart library

*Note: See [Tutorial](@ref flatbuffers_guide_tutorial) for a more in-depth
example of how to use FlatBuffers in Dart.*

FlatBuffers supports reading and writing binary FlatBuffers in Dart.

To use FlatBuffers in your own code, first generate Dart classes from your
schema with the `--dart` option to `flatc`. Then you can include both FlatBuffers
and the generated code to read or write a FlatBuffer.

For example, here is how you would read a FlatBuffer binary file in Dart: First,
include the library and generated code. Then read a FlatBuffer binary file into
a `List<int>`, which you pass to the factory constructor for `Monster`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.dart}
import 'dart:io' as io;

import 'package:flat_buffers/flat_buffers.dart' as fb;
import './monster_my_game.sample_generated.dart' as myGame;

List<int> data = await new io.File('monster.dat').readAsBytes();
var monster = new myGame.Monster(data);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can access values like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.dart}
var hp = monster.hp;
var pos = monster.pos;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Differences from the Dart SDK Front End flat_buffers

The work in this repository is signfiicantly based on the implementation used
internally by the Dart SDK in the front end/analyzer package. Several
significant changes have been made.

1. Support for packed boolean lists has been removed.  This is not standard
   in other implementations and is not compatible with them.  Do note that,
   like in the JavaScript implementation, __null values in boolean lists
   will be treated as false__.  It is also still entirely possible to pack data
   in a single scalar field, but that would have to be done on the application
   side.
2. The SDK implementation supports enums with regular Dart enums, which
   works if enums are always indexed at 1; however, FlatBuffers does not
   require that.  This implementation uses specialized enum-like classes to
   ensure proper mapping from FlatBuffers to Dart and other platforms.
3. The SDK implementation does not appear to support FlatBuffer structs or
   vectors of structs - it treated everything as a built-in scalar or a table.
   This implementation treats structs in a way that is compatible with other
   non-Dart implementations, and properly handles vectors of structs.  Many of
   the methods prefixed with 'low' have been prepurposed to support this.
4. The SDK implementation treats int64 and uint64 as float64s. This
   implementation does not.  This may cause problems with JavaScript
   compatibility - however, it should be possible to use the JavaScript
   implementation, or to do a customized implementation that treats all 64 bit
   numbers as floats.  Supporting the Dart VM and Flutter was a more important
   goal of this implementation.  Support for 16 bit integers was also added.
5. The code generation in this offers an "ObjectBuilder", which generates code
   very similar to the SDK classes that consume FlatBuffers, as well as Builder
   classes, which produces code which more closely resembles the builders in 
   other languages. The ObjectBuilder classes are easier to use, at the cost of
   additional references allocated.

## Text Parsing

There currently is no support for parsing text (Schema's and JSON) directly
from Dart, though you could use the C++ parser through Dart Native Extensions.
Please see the C++ documentation for more on text parsing (note that this is
not currently an option in Flutter - follow [this issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/7053)
for the latest).

## Object based API

FlatBuffers is all about memory efficiency, which is why its base API is written
around using as little as possible of it. This does make the API clumsier
(requiring pre-order construction of all data, and making mutation harder).

For times when efficiency is less important a more convenient object based API
can be used (through `--gen-object-api`) that is able to unpack & pack a FlatBuffer
into objects and lists, allowing for convenient construction, access and mutation.

To use:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.dart}
    // Deserialize from buffer into object.
    MonsterT monster = Monster(flatbuffer).unpack();

    // Update object directly like a Dart class instance.
    print(monster.Name);
    monster.Name = "Bob";  // Change the name.

    // Serialize into new flatbuffer.
    final fbb = Builder();
    fbb.Finish(monster.pack(fbb));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
