//! # FlatBuffers
//!
//! A library for memory-efficient serialization of data.
//!
//! This crate provides runtime support for the FlatBuffers format in the Rust programming language.
//! To use this crate, first generate code with the `flatc` compiler, as described here: <https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/>
//! Then, include that code into your project.
//! Finally, add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! At this time, Rust support is experimental, and APIs may change between minor versions.
//!
//! At this time, to generate Rust code, you will need the latest `master` version of `flatc`, available from here: <https://github.com/google/flatbuffers>
//! (On OSX, you can install FlatBuffers from `HEAD` with the Homebrew package manager.)
